3	testing subgraphs in directed graphs. we show that in this case g contains at least f(e, h)nh copies of h. this is proved by establishing a directed version of szemeredi s regularity lemma, and implies that for every h there is a one sided error property tester whose query complexity is bounded by a function of e only for testing the property ph of being h free.as is common with applications of the undirected regularity lemma, here too the function # f(e,h) is an extremely fast growing function in e. we therefore further prove a precise characterization of all the digraphs h, for which f(e,h) has a polynomial dependency on e. this implies a characterization of all the digraphs h, for which the property of being h free has a one sided error property tester whose query complexity is polynomial in # e. we further show that the same characterization also applies to two sided error property testers as well. we also show that the complexity of deciding if for a given directed graph h, ph has a polynomial query complexity, is np complete, marking an interesting distinction from the case of undirected graphs.for some special cases of directed graphs h, we describe very efficient one sided error property testers for testing ph. as a consequence we conclude that when h is an undirected bipartite graph, we can give a one sided error property tester with query complexity o((# e)h #), improving the previously known upper bound o((# e)h#).	contains a (v,  ,c#,  ) m sequence    for some #              #(c#) (  #(c#) as in the de   nition of the strong eh property). it can be proven (standard application of the regularity lemma for tournaments, see  <cite>) that n(v,  ) is    nite. formal proof may be found in <cite>, therefore we will not repeat it now. we will prove that every h free tournament t contains a transitive subtournament of size at least  t   (n,

108	identifying the agricultural imprint on the global n#o budget using stable isotopes. we observed large shifts with time in the emission rate (from ### to ## ng n cm   # h   #) and in   ##n of n#o emitted (from    ##    to +#    relative to atmospheric n#) from a urea fertilized and irrigated agricultural field in mexico. we calculated overall instantaneous enrichment factors for the sampling period, which suggest that the microbial n#o production shifts from nitrification (week #) to denitrification (week #). the overall   ##n signature we measured for n#o emitted from n fertilized agricultural systems is more depleted than observed   ##n values for n#o emitted from more n limited forest soils. assuming that one half of the total agricultural n#o emissions associated with the global increase in soil nitrogen fertilizer use have an isotopic composition comparable to those of the agricultural fields reported here, we predict a decline in the isotopic signature of tropospheric n#o during this century of as much as #    for ##n. although many uncertainties remain, we suggest that measurements of   ##n n#o in firn air will provide constraints on how the n#o budget has changed during the past century.	it is difficult to assess the proportion of n#o emissions attributed directly to fertilizer n addition without using isotopic tracers, such as ##n <cite>.

112	real time computation at the edge of chaos in recurrent neural networks. we analyze how the type of dynamics (ordered or chaotic) exhibited by randomly connected networks of threshold gates driven by a time varying input signal depends on the parameters describing the distribution of the connectivity matrix. in particular, we calculate the critical boundary in parameter space where the transition from ordered to chaotic dynamics takes place. employing a recently developed framework for analyzing real time computations, we show that only near the critical boundary can such networks perform complex computations on time series.	thus, the best value of g for a particular target function is at the       edge of chaos       <cite>, that is the g value just below the point where force learning fails to suppress chaotic activity during training.

327	a decision theoretic generalization of on line learning and an application to boosting. in the first part of the paper we consider the problem of dynamically apportioning resources among a set of options in a worst case on line framework. the model we study can be interpreted as a broad, abstract extension of the well studied on line prediction model to a general decision theoretic setting. we show that the multiplicative weight update littlestone?warmuth we show how the resulting learning algorithm can be applied to a variety of problems, including gambling, multiple outcome prediction, repeated games, and prediction of points in rn. in the second part of the paper we apply the multiplicative weight update technique to derive a new boosting algorithm. we also study generalizations of the new boosting algorithm to the problem of learning functions whose range, rather than being binary, is an arbitrary finite set or a bounded segment of the real line.	the adaboost algorithm, introduced in #### by freund and schapire <cite>, solved many of the practical difficul   ties of the earlier boosting algorithms, and is the fo   cus of this paper. freund and schapire <cite> prove that the training error (the fraction of mistakes on the training set) of the final hypothesis h is at most fveund and schapire <cite> showed how to bound the generalization error of the final hypothesis in terms of its training error, the size m of the sample, the vcdimension d of the weak hypothesis space and the num  the most straightforward general   ization <cite>, called adaboost.ml, is adequate when the weak learner is strong enough to achieve reasonably high accuracy, even on the hard distributions created by ada boost. schapire and singer s <cite> algorithm adaboost.mh works by creating a set of binary problems, for each example x and each possible label of the form   for example x, is the correct label or is it one of the other labels?  freund and schapire s <cite> algorithm adaboost m# <cite> instead creates binary problems, for each example with correct label and ...

333	effects of the murine genotype on t cell activation and cytokine production in murine mercury induced autoimmunity. this study examines t cell activation and cytokine production following mercury exposure in genetically susceptible and resistant strains. we conclude that autoimmunogenic doses of hgcl # induce an activation and proliferation of t cells in genetically susceptible mouse strains, as well as a broad increase of cytokine producing cells, followed by a late predominance of the th# associated il #.	mercury also altered production of various cytokines in both human and murine lymphocytes <cite>, such as interleukin # (il #), il #, il #, andinterferonc (ifnc), and proto oncoprotein c myc <cite>. in both liver and kidney, relatively high concentrations of mercury increased expressions of tnfa, il ##, ifnc, and mhc ii. in previous reports cytokines such as tnfa, il #, il #, il ##, and ifnc were induced after in vivo or in vitro mercury treatments and may have contributed to the immunologic and cell proliferative responses <cite>. the involvement of mhc ii suggests that the two cell types, t cells and macrophages, are required for polyclonal proliferation, and may contribute to mercuryinduced immunologic responses, including autoimmunity <cite>.

366	verifying multi threaded software using smt based context bounded model checking. we describe and evaluate three approaches to model check multi threaded software with shared variables and locks using bounded model checking based on satisfiability modulo theories (smt) and our modelling of the synchronization primitives of the pthread library. in the lazy approach, we generate all possible interleavings and call the smt solver on each of them individually, until we either find a bug, or have systematically explored all interleavings. in the schedule recording approach, we encode all possible interleavings into one single formula and then exploit the high speed of the smt solvers. in the underapproximation and widening approach, we reduce the state space by abstracting the number of interleavings from the proofs of unsatisfiability generated by the smt solvers. in all three approaches, we bound the number of context switches allowed among threads in order to reduce the number of interleavings explored. we implemented these approaches in esbmc, our smt based bounded model checker for ansi c programs. our experiments show that esbmc can analyze larger problems and substantially reduce the verification time compared to state of the art techniques that use iterative context bounding algorithms or counter example guided abstraction refinement.	there are also approaches that overcome the difficulties of using model checking on multi threaded programs with large search spaces <cite>.

769	optimistic linear programming gives logarithmic regret for irreducible mdps. we present an algorithm called optimistic linear programming (olp) for learning to optimize average reward in an irreducible but otherwise unknown markov decision process (mdp). we show that the total expected reward obtained by olp up to time t is within c(p) log t of the reward obtained by the optimal policy, where c(p) is an explicit, mdp dependent constant. olp is closely related to an algorithm proposed by burnetas and katehakis with four key differences  olp is simpler, it does not require knowledge of the supports of transition probabilities, the proof of the regret bound is simpler, but our regret bound is a constant factor larger than the regret of their algorithm.	n ris completely known, with the only uncertainty being in the transition kernel of the unknown mdp. the extension to problems with unknown rewards is well known from here <cite>. a (stationary) policy or control cis a prescription to (deterministically) play an action at every state of the mdp, i.e., c  s   a. let cdenote the set of all stationary policies# over (s,a), which a
770	do bonds span volatility risk in the u s treasury market a specification test for affine term structure models. we investigate whether bonds span the volatility risk in the u.s. to this end, we construct powerful and model free empirical measures of the quadratic yield variation for a cross section of fixed maturity zero coupon bonds ( realized yield volatility ) through the use of high frequency data. we find that the yield curve fails to span yield volatility, as the systematic volatility factors are largely unrelated to the cross section of yields. we conclude that a broad class of affine diffusive, gaussian quadratic and affine jump diffusive models is incapable of accommodating the observed yield volatility dynamics. we also advocate using the empirical realized yield volatility measures more broadly as a basis for specification testing and (parametric) model selection within the term structure literature.	<cite> have documented that an egarch representation for the conditional yield volatility provides a convenient and successful parsimonious model for the conditional heteroskedasticity in these series.

1039	the psychology of physical symptoms. we all experience them, use them as signals to guide our behavior, and usually assume that they accurately represent underlying physiological activity. at the same time, we implicitly know that bodily sensations are often vague, ambiguous, and subject to a variety of interpretations. it is not surprising, then, that there is often a disparity between what we think is going on in our bodies and what is objectively occurring. my own research into physical symptoms started by accident several years ago. people s perceptions of symptoms were easily influenced by our manipulations, even though their actual physiological state had not changed.	increased symptom reporting and health care use among persons with affective disturbances might occur because negative moods result in negative biases in the evaluation and categorization of stimuli  for example, facilitating the labeling of physical sensations as representing negative consequences (symptoms and pain) and defining symptom constellations as disease states <cite>.

1044	the asymptotic properties of gmm and indirect inference under second order identification. this paper presents a limiting distribution theory for gmm and indirect inference estimators when local identification conditions fail at first order but hold at second order. these limit distributions are shown to be non standard, but we show that they can be easily simulated, making it possible to perform inference about the parameters in this setting. we illustrate our results in the context of a dynamic panel data model in which the parameter of interest is identified locally at second order by non linear moment restrictions but not at first order at a particular point in the parameter space. our simulation results indicate that our theory leads to reliable inferences in moderate to large samples in the neighbourhood of this point of first order identification failure.	dovonon and hall <cite> have derived the asymptotic distribution of the generalized method of moment (gmm) estimator when the jacobian matrix of the moment function is of rank p     # while

1047	the association between glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchored proteins and heterotrimeric g protein alpha subunits in lymphocytes. here we show that gpi anchored proteins are associated with alpha subunits of heterotrimeric gtp binding proteins (g proteins) in both human and murine lymphocytes. when the gpi anchored proteins cd##, cd##, and thy # were immunoprecipitated from various cell lines or freshly isolated lymphocytes, all were found to be associated with a ## kda phosphoprotein that we have identified, by using specific antisera, as a mixture of tyrosine phosphorylated g protein alpha subunits  a small amount of gialpha#, and substantial amounts of gialpha# and gialpha#. thus, we have shown by both immunochemical and functional criteria that gpi anchored proteins are physically associated with g proteins.	gai subunits are present in t cells but the specific signaling role they have has not been fully characterized <cite>. human immune cells have been shown to express at least two of the # gai subunits <cite>, but it is not clear if there is preferential expression of the different gai subunits in mouse immune cells, particularly t lymphocytes. this study newly demonstrated that the gai# and gai# are the gai subunits expressed in murine splenic t cells, extending previous reports concerning human blood t cells <cite>.

1081	three distinct ventral occipitotemporal regions for reading and object naming. abstract   this study investigates word and object processing during naming and viewing tasks and identifies three distinct regions in the left ventral occipitotemporal cortex. in addition, we found that word processing resulted in greater activation than object processing on the dorsal surface of the left superior temporal gyrus and the left supramarginal gyrus.	mentioned that the conjunction of words and sounds, relative to the noise baselines, activated regions of the bilateral cerebellum, while semantic decisions increased activation in the left cerebellum for words only. however, the authors did not propose any hypothesis regarding the cerebellar contribution to this auditory input task.   visual input among the studies which used visual input tasks, ten included the cerebellum in the neuroimaging data. two of these ten studies did not report any data from the cerebellum. of the other eight papers, six mentioned a bilateral activation of cerebellar structures, and two reported an activation of the right side of the cerebellum. it seems difficult to account for the differences between bilateral or right unilateral activations on the basis of the nature of the required processing. for example, moore and price [

1120	learning depth from single monocular images. we consider the task of depth estimation from a single monocular image. we take a supervised learning approach to this problem, in which we begin by collecting a training set of monocular images (of unstructured outdoor environments which include forests, trees, buildings, etc.) then, we apply supervised learning to predict the depthmap as a function of the image. our model uses a discriminatively trained markov random field (mrf) that incorporates multiscale local  and global image features, and models both depths at individual points as well as the relation between depths at different points. we show that, even on unstructured scenes, our algorithm is frequently able to recover fairly accurate depthmaps.	mation rates on nyu depth and kitti, as well as improved qualitative outputs. # related work directly related to our work are several approaches that estimate depth from a single image. saxena et al. <cite> predict depth from a set of image features using linear regression and a mrf, and later extend their work into the make#d <cite> system for #d model generation. however, the system relies on horizontal

1123	herpes simplex virus type # infection of activated cytotoxic t cells induction of fratricide as a mechanism of viral immune evasion. we have observed that in contrast to the situation in human fibroblasts, in human t cell lines antigen presentation by major histocompatibility complex class i molecules is not blocked after hsv# infection. to dissect the underlying molecular events, we used a transgenic mouse model of hsv# infection to demonstrate that cd## (apo #, fas) triggered apoptosis is essential for hsv# induced fratricide, whereas tumor necrosis factor (tnf) also contributes to this phenomenon but to a lesser extent. finally, we defined two mechanisms associated with hsv# associated fratricide of antiviral t cells  (a) t cell receptor   mediated upregulation of cd## ligand and (b) a viral    competence to die    signal that renders activated t lymphocytes susceptible to cd## signaling. we propose that induction of fratricide is an important immune evasion mechanism of hsv#, helping the virus to persist in the host organism throughout its lifetime.	furthermore, to help evade host immune detection, infection disrupts cytokine mediated signaling networks crucial for cell mediated immunity <cite>, and apoptosis is induced in activated t lymphocytes and macrophages <cite>. although hsv   s most widely recognized target cells in vivo are epithelial cells at the point of infection and neuronal cells in which latent infections are established, several reports describe infection of t lymphocytes and other inflammatory cells by hsv <cite>.

1156	in vitro transcription of pe## polyhedrin hybrid promoters reveals sequences essential for recognition by the baculovirus induced rna polymerase and for the strength of very late viral promoters. by modifying the preparation of crude nuclear extracts, we have established an assay that permits differentiation between weak late and strong very late viral promoters. based on the sensitivity of our in vitro transcription system, we have investigated the sequences responsible for a functional taag motif and their putative role with respect to the strength of very late promoters. by constructing hybrid promoters between the early pe## and the very late polyhedrin promoters, we demonstrated that the replacement of # nucleotides upstream of the nonfunctional taag sequences in the pe## promoter with the corresponding sequences of the polyhedrin promoter was sufficient for recognition by the virus induced rna polymerase.	the arrow shows the transcription initiation site and the number in parenthesis indicates the nucleotide position relative to the transcription initiation site in sf# cells (#) at the early stage <cite>, ie # <cite>, gp## (#), and pe## <cite> or the late stage (for p#.# [this paper]). at ## hpi, two transcription initiation sites for acmnpv pe## were elucidated in sf# cells, one in a taag motif located # nts upstream of the early cagt motif and another located ### nts downstream of the early motif (fig. #a) <cite>.
1157	reduction of phonon thermal conductivity in nanowires and nanoribbons with dynamically rough surfaces and edges. we present an analytical model and molecular dynamics simulations of the phonon heat transport in nanowires and nanoribbons with anharmonic lattices and dynamically rough surfaces and edges. in agreement with recent experiments on heat transport in single crystalline silicon nanowires with rough surfaces, our model and simulations predict finite and length independent phonon thermal conductivity in such quasi   one dimensional systems, in contrast to anomalous phonon thermal conductivity of corresponding momentum conserving systems with atomically smooth surfaces, divergent with the system length. within our model, the main cause of thermal conductivity reduction is the momentum nonconserving scattering of longitudinal acoustic phonons by anharmonic side phonon leads in quasi   one dimensional phonon waveguides with dynamically rough surface or edge layers. we also show that the superdiffusion of thermal energy in nanoribbons with atomically smooth edges is replaced by the normal diffusion or subdiffusion in nanoribbons with dynamically rough edges.	so far these lengths were not reached in md simulations of carbon nanotubes <cite> and nanoribbons <cite>, and which makes the impression that the nanotubes and nanoribbons have infinite thermal conductivity.

1377	the introduction of international accounting standards in europe implications for international convergence. this paper describes several implementation effects associated with the mandated adoption of international financial reporting standards promulgated by the international accounting standards board in the european union, including a possible increased demand for detailed implementation guidance and for a single european securities regulator.	prior literature argues that the effectiveness of monitoring mechanisms plays a significant role in ensuring compliance with accounting standard <cite>.
1378	indigenous land rights systems in sub saharan africa a constraint on productivity. this article uses cross sectional evidence from ghana, kenya, and rwanda in #### ## to examine the question, are indigenous land rights systems in sub saharan africa a constraint on productivity?	different tenure systems can ensure access to land and stimulate investments in land improvement <cite>. with the right institutions to ensure the compensation for labor and other long term investments on land, customary tenure systems may provide the right set of incentives needed to foster the development of forestry activities <cite>.
1379	stereoscopic image generation based on depth images for #d tv. we present some results to show that the proposed system provides an improvement in image quality of stereoscopic virtual views while maintaining reasonably good depth quality.	eye view and rendered images that were derived using the depth image based rendering method described in <cite> for the right eye view.
1380	big data analytic via soft computing paradigms. large sets of data have been accumulating in all aspects of our lives for a long time.	sos   s are generating big data which makes modeling of such complex systems a challenge indeed <cite>.
1381	plasma cleaning of the flex substrate for flip chip bonding with anisotropic conductive adhesive film.	due to poor adhesion with the flex, void may nucleate at the acf flex interface, which might propagate to the interconnection to loss the electrical conduction <cite>. in our previous piece of research, we studied on the peel strength of chip on flex using acf and tried to improve adhesion through plasma cleaning of the flex substrate <cite>. so, acf material would virtually be bonded with this residue adhesive in the substrate side <cite>.
1382	changes in end tidal co# level following tourniquet deflation during orthopedic surgery. we studied the changes in end tidal co# (etco#) and systemic responses after tourniquet deflation in spontaneously breathing and ventilation controlled patients during orthopedic surgery of both the upper and or the lower extremities. our study yielded new information on the etco# changes as follows  #) the time for etco# level to reach a peak (peak time) was almost constant despite the considerable differences in the increases in etco# both in spontaneous breathing and ventilation controlled groups and the peak time in the former group was shorter than that in the latter group  and #) it was suggested that the increase in etco# in the spontaneously breathing patients was smaller than that in ventilation controlled patients when both patients were subjected to the same conditions on tourniquet time and tourniqueted area. our data showed that the increase in etco# (or paco#) can be large and prolonged in some situations. thus, we recommend continuous etco# monitoring and the proper hyperventilation at tourniquet deflation in order to minimize any adverse effects of acidosis.	the rapid elevation in paco# reported after tourniquet deflation <cite> would consequently result in a corresponding increase in cerebral blood flow (cbf).
1383	the rod pathway in the rabbit retina a depolarizing bipolar and amacrine cell.	however, mammalian rod bipolar cells make connective errors in the normal retina, occasionally contacting cones <cite> and some on center cone bipolar cells in the primate retina also make flat contacts, especially near central retina where space is limited (chun et al.
