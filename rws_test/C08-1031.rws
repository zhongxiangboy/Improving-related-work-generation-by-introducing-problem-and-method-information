sentiment analysis has been studied by many researchers recently. two main directions are sentiment classification at the document and sentence levels , and feature-based opinion mining. (pang et al 2002);(turney 2002) sentiment classification at the document-level investigates ways to classify each evaluative document ( e.g. , product review ) as positive or negative . (riloff and wiebe 2003);(kim and hovy 2004);(wilson et al 2004);(gamon et al 2005);(stoyanov and cardie 2006) sentiment classification at the sentence-level has also been studied  . these works are different from ours as we study comparatives. (hu and liu 2004);(liu et al 2005);(popescu and etzioni 2005);(mei et al 2007) the works in   perform opinion mining at the feature level. the task involves ( 1 ) extracting entity features ( e.g. , " picture quality " and " battery life " in a camera review ) and ( 2 ) finding orientations ( positive , negative or neutral ) of opinions expressed on the features by reviewers. again , our work is different because we deal with comparisons. (hatzivassiloglou and mckeown 1997);(kanayama and nasukawa 2006) discovering orientations of context dependent opinion comparative words is related to identifying domain opinion words . both works use conjunction rules to find such words from large domain corpora. one conjunction rule states that when two opinion words are linked by " and " their opinions are the same. our method is different in three aspects. first , we argue that finding domain opinion words is problematic because in the same domain the same word may indicate different opinions depending on what features it is applied to. for example , in the camera domain , " long " is positive in " the battery life is very long " but negative in it takes a long time to focus. thus , we should consider both the feature and the opinion word rather than only the opinion word. second , we focus on studying opinionated comparative words. third , our technique is quite different as we utilize readily available external opinion sources. (jindal and liu 2006) as discussed in the introduction , a closely related work to ours is . however , it does not find which entities are preferred by authors. (bos and nissim 2006) proposes a method to extract some useful items from superlative sentences. (fiszman et al 2007) studied the problem of identifying which entity has more of certain features in comparative sentences. it does not find which entity is preferred.
