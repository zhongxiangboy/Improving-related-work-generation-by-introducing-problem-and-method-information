0	scaling phrase-based statistical machine translation abstract . we detail the computational complexity and average retrieval times for looking up phrase translations in our suffix array-based data structure .we show how sampling can be used to reduce the retrieval time by orders of magnitude with no loss in translation quality .  based on sampling
1	improving statistical machine translation using word sense disambiguation . we show for the first time that incorporating the predictions of a word sense disambiguation system within a typical phrase-based statistical machine translation ( smt ) model consistently improves translation quality across all three different iwslt chinese- english test sets , as well as producing statistically significant improvements on the larger nist chinese-english mt task and moreover never hurts performance on any test set , according not only to bleu but to all eight most commonly used automatic evaluation metrics .recent work has challenged the assumption that word sense disambiguation ( wsd ) systems are useful for smt .yet smt translation quality still obviously suffers from inaccurate lexical choice .in this paper , we address this problem by investigating a new strategy for integrating wsd into an smt system , that performs fully phrasal multi-word disambiguation .instead of directly incorporating a senseval-style wsd system , we redefine the wsd task to match the exact same phrasal translation disambiguation task faced by phrase-based smt systems .our results provide the first known empirical evidence that lexical semantics are indeed useful for smt , despite claims to the contrary . phrasal translation disambiguation task based on based statistical machine translation ( smt ) model
2	word sense disambiguation improves statistical machine translation . recent research presents conflicting evidence on whether word sense disambiguation ( wsd ) systems can help to improve the performance of statistical machine translation ( mt ) systems .in this paper , we successfully integrate a state-of-the-art wsd system into a state-of-the-art hierarchical phrase-based mt system , hiero .we show for the first time that integrating a wsd system improves the performance of a state-of- the-art statistical mt system on an actual translation task .furthermore , the improvement is statistically significant . statistical machine translation based on statistical machine translation ( mt ) systems
3	fast , easy , and cheap : construction of statistical machine translation models with mapreduce . in recent years , the quantity of parallel training data available for statistical machine translation has increased far more rapidly than the performance of individual computers , resulting in a potentially serious impediment to progress .parallelization of the model- building algorithms that process this data on computer clusters is fraught with challenges such as synchronization , data exchange , and fault tolerance .however , the mapreduce programming paradigm has recently emerged as one solution to these issues : a powerful functional abstraction hides system-level details from the researcher , allowing programs to be transparently distributed across potentially very large clusters of commodity hardware .we describe mapreduce implementations of two algorithms used to estimate the parameters for two word alignment models and one phrase-based translation model , all of which rely on maximum likelihood probability estimates .on a 20-machine cluster , experimental results show that our solutions exhibit good scaling characteristics compared to a hypothetical , optimally-parallelized version of current state-of-the-art single-core tools . statistical machine translation based on maximum likelihood probability estimates
4	improving translation quality by discarding most of the phrasetable . it is possible to reduce the bulk of phrase- tables for statistical machine translation using a technique based on the significance testing of phrase pair co-occurrence in the parallel corpus .the savings can be quite substantial ( up to 90 % ) and cause no reduction in bleu score .in some cases , an improvement in bleu is obtained at the same time although the effect is less pronounced if state-of-the-art phrasetable smoothing is employed . statistical machine translation based on significance testing of phrase pair co - occurrence
5	compressed full-text indexes . full-text indexes provide fast substring search over large text collections .a serious problem of these indexes has traditionally been their space consumption .a recent trend is to develop indexes that exploit the compressibility of the text , so that their size is a function of the compressed text length .this concept has evolved into self-indexes , which in addition contain enough information to reproduce any text portion , so they replace the text .the exciting possibility of an index that takes space close to that of the compressed text , replaces it , and in addition provides fast search over it , has triggered a wealth of activity and produced surprising results in a very short time , which radically changed the status of this area in less than five years .the most successful indexes nowadays are able to obtain almost optimal space and search time simultaneously .in this paper we present the main concepts underlying ( compressed ) self-indexes .we explain the relationship between text entropy and regularities that show up in index structures and permit compressing them .then we cover the most relevant self-indexes , focusing on how they exploit text compressibility to achieve compact structures that can efficiently solve various search problems .our aim is to give the background to understand and follow the developments in this area . search problems based on fast substring search
6	efficient phrase-table representation for machine translation with applications to online mt and speech translation abstract . we will present an efficient representation with two key properties : on-demand loading and a prefix tree structure for the source phrases .we will show that this representation scales well to large data tasks and that we are able to store hundreds of millions of phrase pairs in the phrase-table .for the large chinese english kist task , the memory requirements of the phrase-table are reduced to less than 20 mb using the new representation with no loss in translation quality and speed .additionally , the new representation is not limited to a specific test set , which is important for online or real-time machine translation .one problem in speech translation is the matching of phrases in the input word graph and the phrase-table .we will describe a novel algorithm that effectively solves this combinatorial problem exploiting the prefix tree data structure of the phrase-table .this algorithm enables the use of significantly larger input word graphs in a more efficient way resulting in improved translation quality . online or real - time machine translation based on phrase - table representation
7	an efficient phrase-to-phrase alignment model for arbitrarily long phrase and large corpora abstract . long phrases capture more contexts than short phrases and result in better translation qualities .on the other hand , the increasing amount of bilingual data poses serious problems for storing all possible phrases .in this paper , we describe a novel phraseto-phrase alignment model which allows for arbitrarily long phrases and works for very large bilingual corpora .this model is very efficient in both time and space and the resulting translations are better than the state-of-the-art systems .  based on phraseto - phrase alignment model
