the web people search challenge is closely related to the well-studied entity resolution problem. (9);(15);(18);(23) in our previous work we also have developed interrelated techniques to solve various entity resolution challenges , e.g.  . the approach covered in the paper , however , is not related to those techniques. the key algorithm for training the skyline based classifier is new. in fact , we are unaware of any entity resolution technique that would use a similar approach under any context. 0 (13);(5);(6);(8);(22);(25) there are several research efforts that address specifically web person search and related challenges   . (5) the approach of is based on exploiting the link structure of pages on the web , with the hypotheses that web pages belonging to the same real person are more likely to be linked together. three algorithms are presented for disambiguation , the first is just exploiting the link structure of web pages and forming clusters based on link analysis , the second algorithm is based on word similarities between documents and does clustering using agglomerative / conglomerative double clustering ( a/dc ) , the third approach combines link analysis with a / dc clustering. 0 (21) the work in clusters documents based on the entity ( person , organization , and location ) names and can be applied to the disambiguation of semi-structured documents , such as web pages. the primary new contribution is the development of a document generation model that explains , for a given document how entities of various types ( other person names , locations , and organizations ) are " prinkled " onto the document. (2) in sem-eval 2007 , a workshop on weps task was held . sixteen different teams from different universities have participated to the task. the participated systems utilized named entities , tokens , urls , etc that exist in the documents. it has been shown that as the extracted information increases the quality of the clustering increases. use of different ne recognition tools affects the results of clustering as well. (12) the ne based single link clustering was the one of the top three systems , because the named entity network alone enables to identify most of the individuals. there are also a few publicly available web search engines that offer related functionality , in that web search results are returned in clusters. clusty ( http://www.clusty.com ) from vivisimo inc. and kartoo ( http://www.kartoo.com ) are search engines that return clustered results. however the clusters are determined based on intersection of broad topics ( for instance research related pages could form one cluster and family pages could form another cluster ) or page source , also the clustering does not take into account the fact that multiple persons can have the same name. for all of these engines , clustering is done based on entire web page content or based on the title and abstract from a standard search engine result. zoominfo ( http://www.zoominfo.com/ ) and spock ( http://www.spock.com/ ) are commercially available people search engines. (7);(11);(13);(19) recently , researchers have started to use external databases , such as ontology and web search engine in order to improve the classification and clustering qualities in different domains  . (7);(11);(19) for example , querying the web and utilizing the search results are used for word sense disambiguation ( wsd ) and record linkage in publications domain . the number of queries to a search engine is a bottleneck in these approaches. (19) hence , the study in kanani and mccallum tries to solve the problem in the case of limited resources. the suggested algorithm increased the accuracy of data cleaning while keeping the number of queries to a search engine minimal. (11) similarly the approach in uses the web as a knowledge source for data cleaning. the study proposed a way to formulate queries and used some standard measures like tf / idf similarity to compute the similarity of two different references to an entity. (12);(19) the work in is a complementary work to the one in . (7) in the authors proposed to use the co-occurrence counts for disambiguation of different meanings of words. the authors used web-based similarity measures like webjaccard , webdice , and so on. these measures are also utilized as features for the svm based trainer along with a set of token based features , where the trainer learns the probability of two terms being the same. in this paper , we study a similar approach , where our aim is to increase the quality of the web person search. our study differs from the others in the way we utilize the web search results. in addition , we have used a different way to formulate queries.
