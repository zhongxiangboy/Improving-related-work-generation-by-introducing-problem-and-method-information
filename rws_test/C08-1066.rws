a necessary ( if not sufficient ) condition for true natural language understanding is a mastery of open-domain natural language inference ( nli ) : the task of determining whether a natural-language hypothesis can be inferred from a given premise. (harabagiu and hickl, 2006) indeed , nli can enable more immediate applications , such as semantic search and question answering . (dagan et al., 2005) in recent years a spectrum of approaches to robust , open-domain nli have been explored within the context of the recognizing textual entailment challenge . (jijkoun and de rijke, 2005);(romano et al., 2006);(hickl et al., 2006) up to now , the most successful approaches have used fairly shallow semantic representations , relying on measures of lexical or semantic overlap , pattern-based relation extraction , or approximate matching of predicate-argument structure . such methods , while robust and often effective , are at best partial solutions , unable to explain even simple forms of logical inference. for example , most shallow approaches would fail to license the introduction of large in the following example : ( 1 ) every firm saw costs grow more than expected , even after adjusting for inflation. every large firm saw costs grow. (akhmatova, 2005);(fowler et al., 2005) at the other extreme , some researchers have approached nli as logical deduction , building on work in theoretical semantics to translate sentences into first-order logic ( fol ) , and then applying a theorem prover or model builder . regrettably , such approaches tend to founder on the myriad complexities of full semantic interpretation , including tense , aspect , causality , intensionality , modality , vagueness , idioms , indexicals , ellipsis , and many other issues. ( what is the right fol representation of ( 1 ) , for example ? )(bos and markert, 2006) fol-based systems that have attained high precision have done so at the cost of very poor recall. this work explores a middle way , by developing a computational model of what called natural logic , which characterizes valid patterns of inference in terms of syntactic forms resembling natural language as much as possible. for example , natural logic might sanction ( 1 ) by observing that : in ordinary ( upward monotone ) contexts , deleting modifiers preserves truth ; in downward monotone contexts , inserting modifiers preserves truth ; and every is downward monotone in its restrictor np. a natural logic system can thus achieve the expressivity and precision needed to handle a great variety of simple logical inferences , while side stepping the difficulties of full semantic interpretation.
