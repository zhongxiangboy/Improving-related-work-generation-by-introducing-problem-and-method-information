an empirical approach to the interpretation of superlatives . in this paper we introduce an empirical approach to the semantic interpretation of superlative adjectives .we present a corpus annotated for superlatives and propose an interpretation algorithm that uses a wide-coverage parser and produces semantic representations .we achieve f- scores between 0.84 and 0.91 for detecting attributive superlatives and an accuracy in the range of 0.690.84 for determining the correct comparison set .as far as we are aware , this is the first automated approach to superlatives for open-domain texts and questions . semantic interpretation of superlative adjectives based on interpretation algorithm
interpreting comparative constructions in biomedical text . we propose a methodology using underspecified semantic interpretation to process comparative constructions in medline citations , concentrating on two structures that are prevalent in the research literature reporting on clinical trials for drug therapies .the method exploits an existing semantic processor , semrep , which constructs predications based on the unified medical language system .results of a preliminary evaluation were recall of 70 % , precision of 96 % , and f-score of 81 % .we discuss the generalization of the methodology to other entities such as therapeutic and diagnostic procedures .the available structures in computable format are potentially useful for interpreting outcome statements in medline citations . comparative constructions in medline citations based on underspecified semantic interpretation
pulse : mining customer opinions from free text . we present a prototype system , code-named pulse , for mining topics and sentiment orientation jointly from free text customer feedback .we describe the application of the prototype system to a database of car reviews .pulse enables the exploration of large quantities of customer free text .the user can examine customer opinion � at a glance � or explore the data at a finer level of detail .we describe a simple but effective technique for clustering sentences , the application of a bootstrapping approach to sentiment classification , and a novel user-interface . mining customer opinions based on bootstrapping approach
predicting the semantic orientation of adjectives . we identify and validate from a large corpus constraints from conjunctions on the positive or negative semantic orientation of the conjoined adjectives .a log-linear regression model uses these constraints to predict whether conjoined adjectives are of same or different orientations , achieving 82 % accuracy in this task when each conjunction is considered independently .combining the constraints across many adjectives , a clustering algorithm separates the adjectives into groups of different orientations , and finally , adjectives are labeled positive or negative .evaluations on real data and simulation experiments indicate high levels of performance : classification precision is more than 90 % for adjectives that occur in a modest number of conjunctions in the corpus .  based on log - linear regression model
mining and summarizing customer reviews abstract . as e-commerce is becoming more and more popular , the number of customer reviews that a product receives grows rapidly .for a popular product , the number of reviews can be in hundreds or even thousands .this makes it difficult for a potential customer to read them to make an informed decision on whether to purchase the product .it also makes it difficult for the manufacturer of the product to keep track and to manage customer opinions .for the manufacturer , there are additional difficulties because many merchant sites may sell the same product and the manufacturer normally produces many kinds of products .in this research , we aim to mine and to summarize all the customer reviews of a product .this summarization task is different from traditional text summarization because we only mine the features of the product on which the customers have expressed their opinions and whether the opinions are positive or negative .we do not summarize the reviews by selecting a subset or rewrite some of the original sentences from the reviews to capture the main points as in the classic text summarization .our task is performed in three steps : ( 1 ) mining product features that have been commented on by customers ; ( 2 ) identifying opinion sentences in each review and deciding whether each opinion sentence is positive or negative ; ( 3 ) summarizing the results .this paper proposes several novel techniques to perform these tasks .our experimental results using reviews of a number of products sold online demonstrate the effectiveness of the techniques . mining product features based on 
mining comparative sentences and relations . this paper studies a text mining problem , comparative sentence mining .a comparative sentence expresses an ordering relation between two sets of entities with respect to some common features .for example , the comparative sentence canons optics are better than those of sony and nikon expresses the comparative relation : ( better , { optics } , { canon } , { sony , nikon } ) .given a set of evaluative texts on the web , e.g. , reviews , forum postings , and news articles , the task of comparative sentence mining is ( 1 ) to identify comparative sentences from the texts and ( 2 ) to extract comparative relations from the identified comparative sentences .this problem has many applications .for example , a product manufacturer wants to know customer opinions of its products in comparison with those of its competitors .in this paper , we propose two novel techniques based on two new types of sequential rules to perform the tasks .experimental evaluation has been conducted using different types of evaluative texts from the web .results show that our techniques are very promising . mining comparative sentences and relations based on 
fully automatic lexicon expansion for domain-oriented sentiment analysis . this paper proposes an unsupervised lexicon building method for the detection of polar clauses , which convey positive or negative aspects in a specific domain .the lexical entries to be acquired are called polar atoms , the minimum human-understandable syntactic structures that specify the polarity of clauses .as a clue to obtain candidate polar atoms , we use context coherency , the tendency for same polarities to appear successively in contexts .using the overall density and precision of coherency in the corpus , the statistical estimation picks up appropriate polar atoms among candidates , without any manual tuning of the threshold values .the experimental results show that the precision of polarity assignment with the automatically acquired lexicon was 94 % on average , and our method is robust for corpora in diverse domains and for the size of the initial lexicon . domain - oriented sentiment analysis based on unsupervised lexicon building method
determining the sentiment of opinions . identifying sentiments ( the affective parts of opinions ) is a challenging problem .we present a system that , given a topic , automatically finds the people who hold opinions about that topic and the sentiment of each opinion .the system contains a module for determining word sentiment and another for combining sentiments within a sentence .we experiment with various models of classifying and combining sentiment at word and sentence levels , with promising results . identifying sentiments based on 
opinion observer : analyzing and comparing opinions on the web . the web has become an excellent source for gathering consumer opinions .there are now numerous web sites containing such opinions , e.g. , customer reviews of products , forums , discussion groups , and blogs .this paper focuses on online customer reviews of products .it makes two contributions .first , it proposes a novel framework for analyzing and comparing consumer opinions of competing products .a prototype system called opinion observer is also implemented .the system is such that with a single glance of its visualization , the user is able to clearly see the strengths and weaknesses of each product in the minds of consumers in terms of various product features .this comparison is useful to both potential customers and product manufacturers .for a potential customer , he / she can see a visual side-by-side and feature-by-feature comparison of consumer opinions on these products , which helps him / her to decide which product to buy .for a product manufacturer , the comparison enables it to easily gather marketing intelligence and product benchmarking information .second , a new technique based on language pattern mining is proposed to extract product features from pros and cons in a particular type of reviews .such features form the basis for the above comparison .experimental results show that the technique is highly effective and outperform existing methods significantly . analyzing and comparing consumer opinions based on language pattern mining
modeling facets and opinions in weblogs abstract . the proposed topic-sentiment mixture ( tsm ) model can reveal the latent topical facets in a weblog collection , the subtopics in the results of an ad hoc query , and their associated sentiments .it could also provide general sentiment models that are applicable to any ad hoc topics .with a specifically designed hmm structure , the sentiment models and topic models estimated with tsm can be utilized to extract topic life cycles and sentiment dynamics .empirical experiments on different weblog datasets show that this approach is effective for modeling the topic facets and sentiments and extracting their dynamics from weblog collections .the tsm model is quite general ; it can be applied to any text collections with a mixture of topics and sentiments , thus has many potential applications , such as search result summarization , opinion tracking , and user behavior prediction . search result summarization based on topic - sentiment mixture ( tsm ) model
thumbs up ? we consider the problem of classifying documents not by topic , but by overall sentiment , e.g. , determining whether a review is positive or negative .using movie reviews as data , we find that standard machine learning techniques definitively outperform human-produced baselines .however , the three machine learning methods we employed ( naive bayes , maximum entropy classification , and support vector machines ) do not perform as well on sentiment classification as on traditional topic-based categorization .we conclude by examining factors that make the sentiment classification problem more challenging . sentiment classification problem based on maximum entropy classification
extracting product features and opinions from reviews . consumers are often forced to wade through many on-line reviews in order to make an informed product choice .this paper introduces opine , an unsupervised information- extraction system which mines reviews in order to build a model of important product features , their evaluation by reviewers , and their relative quality across products .compared to previous work , opine achieves 22 % higher precision ( with only 3 % lower recall ) on the feature extraction task .opines novel use of relaxation labeling for finding the semantic orientation of words in context leads to strong performance on the tasks of finding opinion phrases and their polarity . feature extraction task based on unsupervised information - extraction system
learning extraction patterns for subjective expressions abstract . high-precision classifiers label unannotated data to automatically create a large training set , which is then given to an extraction pattern learning algorithm .the learned patterns are then used to identify more subjective sentences .the bootstrapping process learns many subjective patterns and increases recall while maintaining high precision .  based on extraction pattern learning algorithm
toward opinion summarization : linking the sources . we target the problem of linking source mentions that belong to the same entity ( source coreference resolution ) , which is needed for creating opinion summaries .in this paper we describe how source coreference resolution can be transformed into standard noun phrase coreference resolution , apply a state-of-the-art coreference resolution approach to the transformed data , and evaluate on an available corpus of manually annotated opinions . noun phrase coreference resolution based on coreference resolution approach
thumbs up or thumbs down ? this paper presents a simple unsupervised learning algorithm for classifying reviews as recommended ( thumbs up ) or not recommended ( thumbs down ) .the classification of a review is predicted by the average semantic orientation of the phrases in the review that contain adjectives or adverbs .a phrase has a positive semantic orientation when it has good associations ( e.g. , " subtle nuances " ) and a negative semantic orientation when it has bad associations ( e.g. , " very cavalier " ) .in this paper , the semantic orientation of a phrase is calculated as the mutual information between the given phrase and the word " excellent " minus the mutual information between the given phrase and the word " poor " . a review is classified as recommended if the average semantic orientation of its phrases is positive .the algorithm achieves an average accuracy of 74 % when evaluated on 410 reviews from epinions , sampled from four different domains ( reviews of automobiles , banks , movies , and travel destinations ) .the accuracy ranges from 84 % for automobile reviews to 66 % for movie reviews . classification of a review based on unsupervised learning algorithm
just how mad are you ? there has been a recent swell of interest in the automatic identification and extraction of opinions and emotions in text .in this paper , we present the first experimental results classifying the strength of opinions and other types of subjectivity and classifying the subjectivity of deeply nested clauses .we use a wide range of features , including new syntactic features developed for opinion recognition .in 10-fold cross validation experiments using support vector regression , we achieve improvements in mean-squared error over baseline ranging from 57 % to 64 % . automatic identification and extraction of opinions and emotions based on support vector regression
