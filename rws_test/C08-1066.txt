textual entailment resolution via atomic propositions . this paper presents an approach to solving the problem of textual entailment recognition and describes the computer application built to demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach .the method presented here is based on syntax-driven semantic analysis and uses the notion of atomic proposition as its main element for entailment recognition .the idea is to find the entailment relation in the sentence pairs by comparing the atomic propositions contained in the text and hypothesis sentences .the comparison of atomic propositions is performed via an automated deduction system otter ; the propositions are extracted from the output of the link parser ; and semantic knowledge is taken from the wordnet database .on its current stage the system is capable to recognize basic semantically and syntactically based entailments and is potentially capable to use more external and internal knowledge to deal with more complex entailments . textual entailment recognition based on syntax - driven semantic analysis
when logical inference helps determining textual entailment ( and when it doesn 't ) . we compare and combine two methods to approach the second textual entailment challenge ( rte-2 ) : a shallow method based mainly on word-overlap and a method based on logical inference , using first-order theorem proving and model building techniques .we use a machine learning technique to combine features of both methods .we submitted two runs , one using only the shallow features , yielding an accuracy of 61.6 % , and one using features of both methods , performing with an accuracy score of 60.6 % .these figures suggest that logical inference didnt help much .closer inspection of the results revealed that only for some of the subtasks logical inference played a significant role in performance .we try to explain the reason for these results . textual entailment challenge based on first - order theorem proving
the pascal recognising textual entailment challenge . this paper describes the pascal netwrk of excellence recognising textual entailment ( rte ) challenge benchmark ' .the rte task is defined as recognizing , given two text fragments , whether the meaning of one text can be inferred ( entailed ) from the other .this application- independent task is suggested as capturing major inferences about the variability of semantic expression which are commonly needed across multiple applications .the challenge has raised noticeable attention in the research community , attracting 17 submissions from diverse groups , suggesting the generic relevance of the task . pascal recognising textual entailment challenge based on 
applying cogex to recognize textual entailment . the pascal rte challenge has helped lcc to explore the applicability of enhancements that have been made to our logic form representation and wordnet lexical chains generator .our system transforms each t-h pair into logic form representation with semantic relations .the system automatically generates nlp axioms serving as linguistic rewriting rules and lexical chain axioms that connect concepts in the hypothesis and text .a light set of simple hand-coded world knowledge axioms are also included .our cogex logic prover is then used to attempt to prove entailment .semantic relations , wordnet lexical chains , and nlp axioms all helped the logic prover detect entailment . wordnet lexical chains generator based on logic form representation
using scenario knowledge in automatic question answering . this paper describes a novel framework for using scenario knowledge in open- domain question answering ( q / a ) applications that uses a state-of-the-art textual entailment system ( hickl et al. , 2006b ) in order to discover textual information relevant to the set of topics associated with a scenario description .an intrinsic and an extrinsic evaluation of this method is presented in the context of an automatic q / a system and results from several user scenarios are discussed . automatic question answering based on textual entailment system
recognizing textual entailment with lccs groundhog system . we introduce a new system for recognizing textual entailment ( known as groundhog ) which utilizes a classification-based approach to combine lexico-semantic information derived from text processing applications with a large collection of paraphrases acquired automatically from the www .trained on 200,000 examples of textual entailment extracted from newswire corpora , our system managed to classify more than 75 % of the pairs in the 2006 pascal rte test set correctly . recognizing textual entailment based on classification - based approach
recognizing textual entailment using lexical similarity . we describe our participation in the pascal-2005 recognizing textual entailment challenge .our method is based on calculating directed sentence similarity : checking the directed semantic word overlap between the text and the hypothesis .we use frequency-based term weighting in combination with two different lexical similarity measures .our best run shows 0.55 accuracy on the test data , although the difference between our two runs is not significant .we found remarkably different optimal threshold values for the development and test data .we argue that , in addition to accuracy , precision and recall are valuable measures to consider for textual entailment . calculating directed sentence similarity based on frequency - based term weighting
investigating a generic paraphrase-based approach for relation extraction . unsupervised paraphrase acquisition has been an active research field in recent years , but its effective coverage and performance have rarely been evaluated .we propose a generic paraphrase-based approach for relation extraction ( re ) , aiming at a dual goal : obtaining an applicative evaluation scheme for paraphrase acquisition and obtaining a generic and largely unsupervised configuration for re .we analyze the potential of our approach and evaluate an implemented prototype of it using an re dataset .our findings reveal a high potential for unsupervised paraphrase acquisition .we also identify the need for novel robust models for matching paraphrases in texts , which should address syntactic complexity and variability . unsupervised paraphrase acquisition based on applicative evaluation scheme
