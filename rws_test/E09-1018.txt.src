0	clustering algorithms for noun phrase coreference resolution . in this paper , we present four clustering algorithms for noun phrase coreference resolution .we developed two novel algorithms for this task , a fuzzy algorithm and its hard variant and evaluated their performance on two different sets of texts in comparison with an existing fuzzy and a hard clustering algorithm that are described in the literature .our algorithms perform slightly better and do not rely on a predefined threshold distance value for cluster membership .in addition , our fuzzy clustering algorithm seems to perform better than a hard clustering on a pronoun resolution task .keywords : coreference resolution , clustering . noun phrase coreference resolution based on fuzzy and a hard clustering algorithm
1	noun phrase coreference as clustering . this paper introduces a new , unsupervised algorithm for noun phrase coreference resolution .it differs from existing methods in that it views coreference resolution as a clustering task .in an evaluation on the muc-6 coreference resolution corpus , the algorithm achieves an f-measure of 53.6 % , placing it firmly between the worst ( 40 % ) and best ( 65 % ) systems in the muc-6 evaluation .more importantly , the clustering approach outperforms the only muc-6 system to treat coreference resolution as a learning problem .the clustering algorithm appears to provide a flexible mechanism for coordinating the application of context-independent and context-dependent constraints and preferences for accurate partitioning of noun phrases into coreference equivalence classes . noun phrase coreference resolution based on unsupervised algorithm
2	an expectation maximization approach to pronoun resolution . we propose an unsupervised expectation maximization approach to pronoun resolution .the system learns from a fixed list of potential antecedents for each pronoun .we show that unsupervised learning is possible in this context , as the performance of our system is comparable to supervised methods .our results indicate that a probabilistic gender / number model , determined automatically from unlabeled text , is a powerful feature for this task . pronoun resolution based on unsupervised expectation maximization approach
3	a statistical approach to anaphora resolution abstract . we incorporate multiple anaphora resolution factors into a statistical framework ï¿½ specifically the distance between the pronoun and the proposed antecedent , gender / number / animaticity of the proposed antecedent , governing head information and noun phrase repetition .we combine them into a single probability that enables to identify the referent .our first experiment shows the relative contribution of each source of information and demonstrates a success rate of 82.9 % for all sources combined .the second experiment investigates a method for unsupervised learning of gender / number / animaticity information .we present some experiments illustrating the accuracy of the method and note that with this information added , our pronoun resolution method achieves 84.2 % accuracy . anaphora resolution based on pronoun resolution method
4	unsupervised coreference resolution in a nonparametric bayesian model . we present an unsupervised , nonparametric bayesian approach to coreference resolution which models both global entity identity across a corpus as well as the sequential anaphoric structure within each document .while most existing coreference work is driven by pairwise decisions , our model is fully generative , producing each mention from a combination of global entity properties and local attentional state .despite being unsupervised , our system achieves a 70.3 muc f1 measure on the muc-6 test set , broadly in the range of some recent supervised results . unsupervised coreference resolution based on nonparametric bayesian model
5	competitive self-trained pronoun interpretation . we describe a system for pronoun interpretation that is self-trained from raw data , that is , using no annotated training data .the result outperforms a hobbsian baseline algorithm and is only marginally inferior to an essentially identical , state-of-the-art supervised model trained from a substantial manually-annotated coreference corpus . pronoun interpretation based on hobbsian baseline algorithm
6	a corpus-based investigation of definite description use . we present the results of a study of definite descriptions use in written texts aimed at assessing the feasibility of annotating corpora with information about definite description interpretation .we ran two experiments , in which subjects were asked to classify the uses of definite descriptions in a corpus of 33 newspaper articles , containing a total of 1412 definite descriptions .we measured the agreement among annotators about the classes assigned to definite descriptions , as well as the agreement about the antecedent assigned to those definites that the annotators classified as being related to an antecedent in the text .the most interesting result of this study from a corpus annotation perspective was the rather low agreement ( k = 0.63 ) that we obtained using versions of hawkins and princes classification schemes ; better results ( k = 0.76 ) were obtained using the simplified scheme proposed by fraurud that includes only two classes , first-mention and subsequent-mention .the agreement about antecedents was also not complete .these findings raise questions concerning the strategy of evaluating systems for definite description interpretation by comparing their results with a standardized annotation .from a linguistic point of view , the most interesting observations were the great number of discourse-new definites in our corpus ( in one of our experiments , about 50 % of the definites in the collection were classified as discourse-new , 30 % as anaphoric , and 18 % as associative / bridging ) and the presence of definites which did not seem to require a complete disambiguation .this paper will appear in computational linguistics . definite description interpretation based on hawkins and princes classification schemes
7	a corpus-based evaluation of centering and pronoun resolution . in this paper we compare pronoun resolution algorithms and introduce a centering algorithm ( left- right centering ) that adheres to the constraints and rules of centering theory and is an alternative to brennan , friedman , and pollard 's ( 1987 ) algorithm .we then use the left-right centering algorithm to see if two psycholinguistic claims on cf-list ranking will actually improve pronoun resolution accuracy .our results from this investigation lead to the development of a new syntax- based ranking of the cf-list and corpus-based evidence that contradicts the psycholinguistic claims . pronoun resolution based on left - right centering algorithm
