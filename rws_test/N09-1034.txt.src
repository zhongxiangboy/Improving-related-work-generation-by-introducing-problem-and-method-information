0	alignment-based discriminative string similarity . a character-based measure of similarity is an important component of many natural language processing systems , including approaches to transliteration , coreference , word alignment , spelling correction , and the identification of cognates in related vocabularies .we propose an alignment-based discriminative framework for string similarity .we gather features from substring pairs consistent with a character-based alignment of the two strings .this approach achieves exceptional performance ; on nine separate cognate identification experiments using six language pairs , we more than double the precision of traditional orthographic measures like longest common subsequence ratio and dices coefficient .we also show strong improvements over other recent discriminative and heuristic similarity functions . alignment - based discriminative string similarity based on discriminative and heuristic similarity functions
1	guiding semi-supervision with constraint-driven learning . over the last few years , two of the main research directions in machine learning of natural language processing have been the study of semi-supervised learning algorithms as a way to train classifiers when the labeled data is scarce , and the study of ways to exploit knowledge and global information in structured learning tasks .in this paper , we suggest a method for incorporating domain knowledge in semi-supervised learning algorithms .our novel framework unifies and can exploit several kinds of task specific constraints .the experimental results presented in the information extraction domain demonstrate that applying constraints helps the model to generate better feedback during learning , and hence the framework allows for high performance learning with significantly less training data than was possible before on these tasks . machine learning of natural language processing based on semi - supervised learning algorithms
2	active sample selection for named entity transliteration . this paper introduces a new method for identifying named-entity ( ne ) transliterations within bilingual corpora .current state-of-the- art approaches usually require annotated data and relevant linguistic knowledge which may not be available for all languages .we show how to effectively train an accurate transliteration classifier using very little data , obtained automatically .to perform this task , we introduce a new active sampling paradigm for guiding and adapting the sample selection process .we also investigate how to improve the classifier by identifying repeated patterns in the training data .we evaluated our approach using english , russian and hebrew corpora . named entity transliteration based on transliteration classifier
3	prototype-driven learning for sequence models . we investigate prototype-driven learning for primarily unsupervised sequence modeling .prior knowledge is specified declaratively , by providing a few canonical examples of each target annotation label .this sparse prototype information is then propagated across a corpus using distributional similarity features in a log-linear generative model .on part-of-speech induction in english and chinese , as well as an information extraction task , prototype features provide substantial error rate reductions over competitive baselines and outperform previous work .for example , we can achieve an english part-of-speech tagging accuracy of 80.5 % using only three examples of each tag and no dictionary constraints .we also compare to semi-supervised learning and discuss the system ï¿½ s error trends . unsupervised sequence modeling based on log - linear generative model
4	an english to korean transliteration model of extended markov window . automatic transliteration problem is to transcribe foreign words in one 's own alphabet .machine generated transliteration can be useful in various applications such as indexing in an information retrieval system and pronunciation synthesis in a text-to-speech system .in this paper we present a model for statistical englishto-korean transliteration that generates transliteration candidates with probability .the model is designed to utilize various information sources by extending a conventional markov window .also , an efficient and accurate method for alignment and syllabification of pronunciation units is described .the experimental results show a recall of 0.939 for trained words and 0.875 for untrained words when the best 10 candidates are considered . statistical englishto - korean transliteration based on english to korean transliteration model
5	named entity transliteration and discovery from multilingual comparable corpora . named entity recognition ( ner ) is an important part of many natural language processing tasks .most current approaches employ machine learning techniques and require supervised data .however , many languages lack such resources .this paper presents an algorithm to automatically discover named entities ( nes ) in a resource free language , given a bilingual corpora in which it is weakly temporally aligned with a resource rich language .we observe that nes have similar time distributions across such corpora , and that they are often transliterated , and develop an algorithm that exploits both iteratively .the algorithm makes use of a new , frequency based , metric for time distributions and a resource free discriminative approach to transliteration .we evaluate the algorithm on an english-russian corpus , and show high level of nes discovery in russian . natural language processing tasks based on resource free discriminative approach
6	machine transliteration abstract . these items are commonly transliterated , i.e. , replaced with approximate phonetic equivalents .for example , " computer " in english comes out as " konpyuutaa " in japanese .translating such items from japanese back to english is even more challenging , and of practical interest , as transliterated items make up the bulk of text phrases not found in bilingual dictionaries .we describe and evaluate a method for performing backwards transliterations by machine .this method uses a generative model , incorporating several distinct stages in the transliteration process . backwards transliterations based on transliteration process
7	a joint source-channel model for machine transliteration . most foreign names are transliterated into chinese , japanese or korean with approximate phonetic equivalents .the transliteration is usually achieved through intermediate phonemic mapping .this paper presents a new framework that allows direct orthographical mapping ( dom ) between two different languages , through a joint source-channel model , also called n-gram transliteration model ( tm ) .with the n-gram tm model , we automate the orthographic alignment process to derive the aligned transliteration units from a bilingual dictionary .the n-gram tm under the dom framework greatly reduces system development effort and provides a quantum leap in improvement in transliteration accuracy over that of other state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms .the modeling framework is validated through several experiments for english-chinese language pair . orthographic alignment process based on n - gram transliteration model
8	incremental integer linear programming for non-projective dependency parsing . integer linear programming has recently been used for decoding in a number of probabilistic models in order to enforce global constraints .however , in certain applications , such as non-projective dependency parsing and machine translation , the complete formulation of the decoding problem as an integer linear program renders solving intractable .we present an approach which solves the problem incrementally , thus we avoid creating intractable integer linear programs .this approach is applied to dutch dependency parsing and we show how the addition of linguistically motivated constraints can yield a significant improvement over state- of-the-art . non - projective dependency parsing based on incremental integer linear programming
9	learning string-edit distance . in many applications , it is necessary to determine the similarity of two strings .a widely-used notion of string similarity is the edit distance : the minimum number of insertions , deletions , and substitutions required to transform one string into the other .in this report , we provide a stochastic model for string-edit distance .our stochastic model allows us to learn a string-edit distance function from a corpus of examples .we illustrate the utility of our approach by applying it to the difficult problem of learning the pronunciation of words in conversational speech .in this application , we learn a string-edit distance with nearly one-fifth the error rate of the untrained levenshtein distance .our approach is applicable to any string classification problem that may be solved using a similarity function against a database of labeled prototypes . string classification problem based on string - edit distance
10	a linear programming formulation for global inference in natural language tasks abstract . examples of these constraints include the type of arguments a relation can take , and the mutual activity of different relations , etc .we develop a linear programming formulation for this problem and evaluate it in the context of simultaneously learning named entities and relations .our approach allows us to efficiently incorporate domain and task specific constraints at decision time , resulting in significant improvements in the accuracy and the human-like quality of the inferences . natural language tasks based on linear programming formulation
11	named entity transliteration with comparable corpora . in this paper we investigate chinese- english name transliteration using comparable corpora , corpora where texts in the two languages deal in some of the same topics and therefore share references to named entities but are not translations of each other .we present two distinct methods for transliteration , one approach using phonetic transliteration , and the second using the temporal distribution of candidate pairs .each of these approaches works quite well , but by combining the approaches one can achieve even better results .we then propose a novel score propagation method that utilizes the co-occurrence of transliteration pairs within document pairs .this propagation method achieves further improvement over the best results from the previous step . chinese - english name transliteration based on phonetic transliteration
