0	cross-language text classification . our goal in cross-language text classification ( cltc ) is to use english training data to classify czech documents ( although the concepts presented here are applicable to any language pair ) .cltc is an off-line problem , and the authors are unaware of any previous work in this area . cross - language text classification based on cltc
1	an em based training algorithm for cross-language text categorization . due to the globalization on the web , many companies and institutions need to efficiently organize and search repositories containing multilingual documents .the management of these heterogeneous text collections increases the costs significantly because experts of different languages are required to organize these collections .cross-language text categorization can provide techniques to extend existing automatic classification systems in one language to new languages without requiring additional intervention of human experts .in this paper we propose a learning algorithm based on the em scheme which can be used to train text classifiers in a multilingual environment .in particular , in the proposed approach , we assume that a predefined category set and a collection of labeled training data is available for a given language l1 .a classifier for a different language l2 is trained by translating the available labeled training set for l1 to l2 and by using an additional set of unlabeled documents from l2 .this technique allows us to extract correct statistical properties of the language l2 which are not completely available in automatically translated examples , because of the different characteristics of language l1 and of the approximation of the translation process .our experimental results show that the performance of the proposed method is very promising when applied on a test document set extracted from newsgroups in english and italian . cross - language text categorization based on automatic classification systems
2	machine learning in automated text categorization . in the research community the dominant approach to this problem is based on machine learning techniques : a general inductive process automatically builds a classifier by learning , from a set of preclassified documents , the characteristics of the categories .the advantages of this approach over the knowledge engineering approach ( consisting in the manual definition of a classifier by domain experts ) are a very good effectiveness , considerable savings in terms of expert labor power , and straightforward portability to different domains .this survey discusses the main approaches to text categorization that fall within the machine learning paradigm .we will discuss in detail issues pertaining to three different problems , namely , document representation , classifier construction , and classifier evaluation . automated text categorization based on knowledge engineering approach
3	cross-lingual text categorization . this article deals with the problem of cross-lingual text categorization ( cltc ) , which arises when documents in different languages must be classified according to the same classification tree .we describe practical and cost-effective solutions for automatic cross-lingual text categorization , both in case a sufficient number of training examples is available for each new language and in the case that for some language no training examples are available .experimental results of the bi-lingual classification of the ilo corpus ( with documents in english and spanish ) are obtained using bi-lingual training , terminology translation and profile-based translation . automatic cross - lingual text categorization based on bi - lingual classification
4	topic detection and tracking in english and chinese . topic detection and tracking ( tdt ) refers to automatic techniques for discovering , threading , and retrieving topically related material in streams of data .newswire and broadcast news are the canonical sources .in 1999 , tdt research was extended from english to chinese , and carefully annotated multilingual corpora were created .researchers devised clever approaches to the cross-language challenge , and formal performance evaluations yielded very promising results .this paper outlines the 1999 research tasks , corpora , evaluation procedures , technical approaches , and results .the multilingual , multimedia research and evaluations are continuing in 2000 and 2001 under the darpa tides program .keywords : speech ; text ; topic ; segmentation ; tracking ; detection . topic detection and tracking based on automatic techniques
5	a re-examination of text categorization methods . this paper reports a controlled study with statistical significance tests on five text categorization methods : the support vector machines ( svm ) , a k-nearest neighbor ( knn ) classifier , a neural network ( nnet ) approach , the linear least-squares fit ( llsf ) mapping and a naive bayes ( nb ) classifier .we focus on the robustness of these methods in dealing with a skewed category distribution , and their performance as function of the training-set category frequency .our results show that svm , knn and llsf significantly outperform nnet and nb when the number of positive training instances per category are small ( less than ten ) , and that all the methods perform comparably when the categories are sufficiently common ( over 300 instances ) .  based on statistical significance tests on five text categorization methods
6	a comparative study on feature selection in text categorization . this paper is a comparative study of feature selection methods in statistical learning of text categorization .the focus is on aggressive dimensionality reduction .five methods were evaluated , including term selection based on document frequency ( df ) , information gain ( ig ) , mutual information ( mi ) , a xz-test ( chi ) , and term strength ( ts ) .we found ig and chi most effective in our experiments .using ig thresholding with a k- nearest neighbor classifier on the reuters corpus , removal of up to 98 % removal of unique terms actually yielded an improved classification accuracy ( measured by average precision ) .df thresholding performed similarly .indeed we found strong correlations between the df , ig and chi values of a term .this suggests that df thresholding , the simplest method with the lowest cost in computation , can be reliably used instead of ig or chi when the computation of these measures are too expensive .ts compares favorably with the other methods with up to 50 % vocabulary reduction but is not competitive at higher vocabulary reduction levels .in contrast , mi had relatively poor performance due to its bias towards favoring rare terms , and its sensitivity to probability estimation errors . statistical learning of text categorization based on k - nearest neighbor classifier
7	unsupervised and supervised clustering for topic tracking . we investigate important differences between two styles of document clustering in the context of topic detection and tracking .converting a topic detection system into a topic tracking system exposes fundamental differences between these two tasks that are important to consider in both the design and the evaluation of tdt systems .we also identify features that can be used in systems for both tasks . document clustering based on unsupervised and supervised clustering
8	exploiting comparable corpora and bilingual dictionaries for cross-language text categorization . cross-language text categorization is the task of assigning semantic classes to documents written in a target language ( e.g.english ) while the system is trained using labeled documents in a source language ( e.g.italian ) .in this work we present many solutions according to the availability of bilingual resources , and we show that it is possible to deal with the problem even when no such resources are accessible .the core technique relies on the automatic acquisition of multilingual domain models from comparable corpora .experiments show the effectiveness of our approach , providing a low cost solution for the cross language text categorization task .in particular , when bilingual dictionaries are available the performance of the categorization gets close to that of monolingual text categorization . automatic acquisition of multilingual domain models based on
