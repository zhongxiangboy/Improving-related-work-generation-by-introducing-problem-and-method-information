0	a probabilistic approach to language change . we present a probabilistic approach to language change in which word forms are represented by phoneme sequences that undergo stochastic edits along the branches of a phylogenetic tree .this framework combines the advantages of the classical comparative method with the robustness of corpus-based probabilistic models .we use this framework to explore the consequences of two different schemes for defining probabilistic models of phonological change , evaluating these schemes by reconstructing ancient word forms of romance languages .the result is an efficient inference procedure for automatically inferring ancient word forms from modern languages , which can be generalized to support inferences about linguistic phylogenies . automatically inferring ancient word forms based on probabilistic models of phonological change
1	computer estimation of vocabulary in a protolanguage from word lists in four daughter languages . even if no written records of a protolanguage remain , it is possible to estimate what some of the words in that language might have been , by comparison of its reflexes in the more recent daughter languages .this method of protolanguage reconstruction is called the comparative method , and is described by crowley ( 1992 , chapter 5 ) .although long practiced by human linguists , the comparative method is extremely time consuming , and only a few parts of the process have previously been automated .this paper describes a program which attempts to replicate the methodology described by crowley almost in its entirety . protolanguage reconstruction based on comparative method
