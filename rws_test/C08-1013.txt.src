0	paraphrasing with bilingual parallel corpora . previous work has used monolingual parallel corpora to extract and generate paraphrases .we show that this task can be done using bilingual parallel corpora , a much more commonly available resource .using alignment techniques from phrase- based statistical machine translation , we show how paraphrases in one language can be identified using a phrase in another language as a pivot .we define a paraphrase probability that allows paraphrases extracted from a bilingual parallel corpus to be ranked using translation probabilities , and show how it can be refined to take contextual information into account .we evaluate our paraphrase extraction and ranking methods using a set of manual word alignments , and contrast the quality with paraphrases extracted from automatic alignments . phrase - based statistical machine translation based on paraphrase extraction and ranking methods
1	sentence fusion for multidocument news summarization . a system that can produce informative summaries , highlighting common information found in many online documents , will help web users to pinpoint information that they need without extensive reading .in this article , we introduce sentence fusion , a novel text-to-text generation technique for synthesizing common information across documents .sentence fusion involves bottom-up local multisequence alignment to identify phrases conveying similar information and statistical generation to combine common phrases into a sentence .sentence fusion moves the summarization field from the use of purely extractive methods to the generation of abstracts that contain sentences not found in any of the input documents and can synthesize information across sources . multidocument news summarization based on text - to - text generation technique
2	extracting paraphrases from a parallel corpus . while paraphrasing is critical both for interpretation and generation of natural language , current systems use manual or semi-automatic methods to collect paraphrases .we present an unsupervised learning algorithm for identification of paraphrases from a corpus of multiple english translations of the same source text .our approach yields phrasal and single word lexical paraphrases as well as syntactic paraphrases . interpretation and generation of natural language based on manual or semi - automatic methods
3	improved statistical machine translation using paraphrases . parallel corpora are crucial for training smt systems .however , for many language pairs they are available only in very limited quantities .for these language pairs a huge portion of phrases encountered at run-time will be unknown .we show how techniques from paraphrasing can be used to deal with these otherwise unknown source language phrases .our results show that augmenting a state- of-the-art smt system with paraphrases leads to significantly improved coverage and translation quality .for a training corpus with 10,000 sentence pairs we increase the coverage of unique test set unigrams from 48 % to 90 % , with more than half of the newly covered items accurately translated , as opposed to none in current approaches .  based on statistical machine translation
4	constructing corpora for the development and evaluation of paraphrase systems . automatic paraphrasing is an important component in many natural language processing tasks .in this article we present a new parallel corpus with paraphrase annotations .we adopt a definition of paraphrase based on word alignments and show that it yields high inter-annotator agreement .as kappa is suited to nominal data , we employ an alternative agreement statistic which is appropriate for structured alignment tasks .we discuss how the corpus can be usefully employed in evaluating paraphrase systems automatically ( e.g. , by measuring precision , recall , and f1 ) and also in developing linguistically rich paraphrase models based on syntactic structure . natural language processing tasks based on linguistically rich paraphrase models
5	unsupervised construction of large paraphrase corpora : exploiting massively parallel news sources abstract . two techniques are employed : ( 1 ) simple string edit distance , and ( 2 ) a heuristic strategy that pairs initial ( presumably summary ) sentences from different news stories in the same cluster .we evaluate both datasets using a word alignment algorithm and a metric borrowed from machine translation .results show that edit distance data is cleaner and more easily-aligned than the heuristic data , with an overall alignment error rate ( aer ) of 11.58 % on a similarly-extracted test set .on test data extracted by the heuristic strategy , however , performance of the two training sets is similar , with aers of 13.2 % and 14.7 % respectively .analysis of 100 pairs of sentences from each set reveals that the edit distance data lacks many of the complex lexical and syntactic alternations that characterize monolingual paraphrase .the summary sentences , while less readily alignable , retain more of the non-trivial alternations that are of greatest interest learning paraphrase relationships . unsupervised construction of large paraphrase corpora based on word alignment algorithm
6	extracting structural paraphrases from aligned monolingual corpora . we present an approach for automatically learning paraphrases from aligned monolingual corpora .our algorithm works by generalizing the syntactic paths between corresponding anchors in aligned sentence pairs .compared to previous work , structural paraphrases generated by our algorithm tend to be much longer on average , and are capable of capturing long-distance dependencies .in addition to a standalone evaluation of our paraphrases , we also describe a question answering application currently under development that could immensely benefit from automatically-learned structural paraphrases . automatically learning paraphrases based on 
7	dirt - discovery of inference rules from text . in this paper , we propose an unsupervised method for discovering inference rules from text , such as x is author of y ^ x wrote y , x solved y ^ x found a solution to y , and x caused y ^ y is triggered by x. inference rules are extremely important in many fields such as natural language processing , information retrieval , and artificial intelligence in general .our algorithm is based on an extended version of harris distributional hypothesis , which states that words that occurred in the same contexts tend to be similar .instead of using this hypothesis on words , we apply it to paths in the dependency trees of a parsed corpus . dirt - discovery of inference rules based on unsupervised method
8	the pyramid method : incorporating human content selection variation in summarization evaluation . human variation in content selection in summarization has given rise to some fundamental research questions : how can one incorporate the observed variation in suitable evaluation measures ?how can such measures reflect the fact that summaries conveying different content can be equally good and informative ?in this paper we address these very questions by proposing a method for analysis of multiple human abstracts into semantic content units .such analysis allows us not only to quantify human variation in content selection , but also to assign empirical importance weight to different content units .it serves as the basis for an evaluation method , the pyramid method , that incorporates the observed variation and is predictive of different equally informative summaries .we discuss the reliability of content unit annotation , the properties of pyramid scores , and their correlation with other evaluation methods . human variation in content selection based on pyramid method
9	bleu : a method for automatic evaluation of machine translation abstract . human evaluations can take months to finish and involve human labor that can not be reused .we propose a method of automatic machine translation evaluation that is quick , inexpensive , and language-independent , that correlates highly with human evaluation , and that has little marginal cost per run .we present this method as an automated understudy to skilled human judges which substitutes for them when there is need for quick or frequent evaluations. automatic evaluation of machine translation abstract based on bleu
