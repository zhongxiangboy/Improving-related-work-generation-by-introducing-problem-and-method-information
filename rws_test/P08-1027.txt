semantic relation classification using physical sizes . although researchers have shown increasing interest in extracting / classifying semantic relations , most previous studies have basically relied on lexical patterns between terms .this paper proposes a novel way to accomplish the task : a system that captures a physical size of an entity .experimental results revealed that our proposed method is feasible and prevents the problems inherent in other methods . extracting / classifying semantic relations based on semantic relation classification
open information extraction from the web . traditionally , information extraction ( ie ) has focused on satisfying precise , narrow , pre-specified requests from small homogeneous corpora ( e.g. , extract the location and time of seminars from a set of announcements ) .shifting to a new domain requires the user to name the target relations and to manually create new extraction rules or hand-tag new training examples .this manual labor scales linearly with the number of target relations .this paper introduces open ie ( oie ) , a new extraction paradigm where the system makes a single data-driven pass over its corpus and extracts a large set of relational tuples without requiring any human input .the paper also introduces textrunner , a fully implemented , highly scalable oie system where the tuples are assigned a probability and indexed to support efficient extraction and exploration via user queries .we report on experiments over a 9,000,000 web page corpus that compare textrunner with knowitall , a state-of-the-art web ie system .textrunner achieves an error reduction of 33 % on a comparable set of extractions .furthermore , in the amount of time it takes knowitall to perform extraction for a handful of pre-specified relations , textrunner extracts a far broader set of facts reflecting orders of magnitude more relations , discovered on the fly .we report statistics on textrunner s 11,000,000 highest probability tuples , and show that they contain over 1,000,000 concrete facts and over 6,500,000 more abstract assertions . open information extraction based on extraction paradigm

unsupervised discovery of generic relationships using pattern clusters and its evaluation by automatically generated sat analogy questions . we present a novel framework for the discovery and representation of general semantic relationships that hold between lexical items .we propose that each such relationship can be identified with a cluster of patterns that captures this relationship .we give a fully unsupervised algorithm for pattern cluster discovery , which searches , clusters and merges high- frequency words-based patterns around randomly selected hook words .pattern clusters can be used to extract instances of the corresponding relationships .to assess the quality of discovered relationships , we use the pattern clusters to automatically generate sat analogy questions .we also compare to a set of known relationships , achieving very good results in both methods .the evaluation ( done in both english and russian ) substantiates the premise that our pattern clusters indeed reflect relationships perceived by humans . unsupervised discovery of generic relationships based on unsupervised algorithm
fully unsupervised discovery of concept-specific relationships by web mining . we present a web mining method for discovering and enhancing relationships in which a specified concept ( word class ) participates .we discover a whole range of relationships focused on the given concept , rather than generic known relationships as in most previous work .our method is based on clustering patterns that contain concept words and other words related to them .we evaluate the method on three different rich concepts and find that in each case the method generates a broad variety of relationships with good precision .  based on web mining method
support vector machines applied to the classification of semantic relations in nominalized noun phrases . the discovery of semantic relations in text plays an important role in many nlp applications .this paper presents a method for the automatic classification of semantic relations in nominalized noun phrases .nominalizations represent a subclass of np constructions in which either the head or the modifier noun is derived from a verb while the other noun is an argument of this verb .especially designed features are extracted automatically and used in a support vector machine learning model .the paper presents preliminary results for the semantic classification of the most representative np patterns using four distinct learning models . automatic classification of semantic relations based on support vector machine learning model
automatic discovery of part-whole relations . an important problem in knowledge discovery from text is the automatic extraction of semantic relations .this paper presents a supervised , semantically intensive , domain independent approach for the automatic detection of part -whole relations in text .first an algorithm is described that identifies lexico-syntactic patterns that encode part-whole relations .a difficulty is that these patterns also encode other semantic relations , and a learning method is necessary to discriminate whether or not a pattern contains a part-whole relation .a large set of training examples have been annotated and fed into a specialized learning system that learns classification rules .the rules are learned through an iterative semantic specialization ( iss ) method applied to noun phrase constituents .classification rules have been generated this way for different patterns such as genitives , noun compounds , and noun phrases containing prepositional phrases to extract part -whole relations from them .the applicability of these rules has been tested on a test corpus obtaining an overall average precision of 80.95 % and recall of 75.91 % .the results demonstrate the importance of word sense disambiguation for this task .they also demonstrate that different lexico-syntactic patterns encode different semantic information and should be treated separately in the sense that different clarification rules apply to different patterns . automatic discovery of part - whole relations based on iterative semantic specialization ( iss ) method

classifying the semantic relations in noun compounds via a domain-specific lexical hierarchy . we are developing corpus-based techniques for identifying semantic relations at an intermediate level of description ( more specific than those used in case frames , but more general than those used in traditional knowledge representation systems ) .in this paper we describe a classification algorithm for identifying relationships between two-word noun compounds .we find that a very simple approach using a machine learning algorithm and a domain-specific lexical hierarchy successfully generalizes from training instances , performing better on previously unseen words than a baseline consisting of training on the words themselves .  based on knowledge representation systems
clustering for unsupervised relation identification . unsupervised relation identification is the task of automatically discovering interesting relations between entities in a large text corpora .relations are identified by clustering the frequently co- occurring pairs of entities in such a way that pairs occurring in similar contexts end up belonging to the same clusters .in this paper we compare several clustering setups , some of them novel and others already tried .the setups include feature extraction and selection methods and clustering algorithms .in order to do the comparison , we develop a clustering evaluation metric , specifically adapted for the relation identification task .our experiments demonstrate significant superiority of the single- linkage hierarchical clustering with the novel threshold selection technique over the other tested clustering algorithms .also , the experiments indicate that for successful relation identification it is important to use rich complex features of two kinds : features that test both relation slots together ( relation features ) , and features that test only one slot each ( entity features ) .we have found that using both kinds of features with the best of the algorithms produces very high-precision results , significantly improving over the previous work . unsupervised relation identification based on feature extraction and selection methods
semantic taxonomy induction from heterogenous evidence . we propose a novel algorithm for inducing semantic taxonomies .previous algorithms for taxonomy induction have typically focused on independent classifiers for discovering new single relationships based on hand-constructed or automatically discovered textual patterns .by contrast , our algorithm flexibly incorporates evidence from multiple classifiers over heterogenous relationships to optimize the entire structure of the taxonomy , using knowledge of a words coordinate terms to help in determining its hypernyms , and vice versa .we apply our algorithm on the problem of sense-disambiguated noun hyponym acquisition , where we combine the predictions of hypernym and coordinate term classifiers with the knowledge in a preexisting semantic taxonomy ( wordnet 2.1 ) .we add 10 , 000 novel synsets to wordnet 2.1 at 84 % precision , a relative error reduction of 70 % over a nonjoint algorithm using the same component classifiers .finally , we show that a taxonomy built using our algorithm shows a 23 % relative f-score improvement over wordnet 2.1 on an independent testset of hypernym pairs . sense - disambiguated noun hyponym acquisition based on semantic taxonomy induction

measuring semantic similarity by latent relational analysis . this paper introduces latent relational analysis ( lra ) , a method for measuring semantic similarity .lra measures similarity in the semantic relations between two pairs of words .when two pairs have a high degree of relational similarity , they are analogous .for example , the pair cat : meow is analogous to the pair dog : bark .there is evidence from cognitive science that relational similarity is fundamental to many cognitive and linguistic tasks ( e.g. , analogical reasoning ) .in the vector space model ( vsm ) approach to measuring relational similarity , the similarity between two pairs is calculated by the cosine of the angle between the vectors that represent the two pairs .the elements in the vectors are based on the frequencies of manually constructed patterns in a large corpus .lra extends the vsm approach in three ways : ( 1 ) patterns are derived automatically from the corpus , ( 2 ) singular value decomposition is used to smooth the frequency data , and ( 3 ) synonyms are used to reformulate word pairs .this paper describes the lra algorithm and experimentally compares lra to vsm on two tasks , answering college-level multiple-choice word analogy questions and classifying semantic relations in noun-modifier expressions .lra achieves state-of-the-art results , reaching human-level performance on the analogy questions and significantly exceeding vsm performance on both tasks . measuring relational similarity based on vector space model ( vsm ) approach
expressing implicit semantic relations without supervision . we present an unsupervised learning algorithm that mines large text corpora for patterns that express implicit semantic relations .for a given input word pair x : y with some unspecified semantic relations , the corresponding output list of patterns p1 , ... , pm is ranked according to how well each pattern pi expresses the relations between x and y. for example , given x = ostrich and y = bird , the two highest ranking output patterns are x is the largest y and y such as the x. the output patterns are intended to be useful for finding further pairs with the same relations , to support the construction of lexicons , ontologies , and semantic networks .the patterns are sorted by pertinence , where the pertinence of a pattern pi for a word pair x : y is the expected relational similarity between the given pair and typical pairs for pi .the algorithm is empirically evaluated on two tasks , solving multiple-choice sat word analogy questions and classifying semantic relations in noun-modifier pairs .on both tasks , the algorithm achieves state- of-the-art results , performing significantly better than several alternative pattern ranking algorithms , based on tf-idf . multiple - choice sat word analogy questions based on unsupervised learning algorithm
