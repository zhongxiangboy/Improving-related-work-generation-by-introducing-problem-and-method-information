our focus in this section is on describing the properties of the two previous systems for reconstructing ancient word forms to which we compare our method. citations for other related work , such as similar approaches to using faithfulness and markedness features , appear in the body of the paper. 0 (oakes 2000) in , the word forms in a given protolanguage are reconstructed using a viterbi multialignment between a small number of its descendant languages. the alignment is computed using handset parameters. deterministic rules characterizing changes between pairs of observed languages are extracted from the alignment when their frequency is higher than a threshold , and a proto-phoneme inventory is built using linguistically motivated rules and parsimony. a reconstruction of each observed word is first proposed independently for each language. if at least two reconstructions agree , a majority vote is taken , otherwise no reconstruction is proposed. this approach has several limitations. first , it is not tractable for larger trees , since the time complexity of their multi-alignment algorithm grows exponentially in the number of languages. second , deterministic rules , while elegant in theory , are not robust to noise : even in experiments with only four daughter languages , a large fraction of the words could not be reconstructed. 0 (bouchard cote et al. 2008) in , a stochastic model of sound change is used and reconstructions are inferred by performing probabilistic inference over an evolutionary tree expressing the relationships between languages. the model does not support generalizations across languages , and has no way to capture phonotactic regularities within languages. as a consequence , the resulting method does not scale to large phylogenies. the work we present here addresses both of these issues , with a richer model and faster inference allowing improved reconstruction and increased scale.
