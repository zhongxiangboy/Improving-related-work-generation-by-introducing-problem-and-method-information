0	a latent dirichlet model for unsupervised entity resolution . entity resolution has received considerable attention in recent years .given many references to underlying entities , the goal is to predict which references correspond to the same entity .we show how to extend the latent dirichlet allocation model for this task and propose a probabilistic model for collective entity resolution for relational domains where references are connected to each other .our approach differs from other recently proposed entity resolution approaches in that it is a ) generative , b ) does not make pair-wise decisions and c ) captures relations between entities through a hidden group variable .we propose a novel sampling algorithm for collective entity resolution which is unsupervised and also takes entity relations into account .additionally , we do not assume the domain of entities to be known and show how to infer the number of entities from the data .we demonstrate the utility and practicality of our relational entity resolution approach for author resolution in two real-world bibliographic datasets .in addition , we present preliminary results on characterizing conditions under which relational information is useful . unsupervised entity resolution based on relational entity resolution approach
1	facile : description of the ne system used for muc-7 . in this paper , we describe the system used by the umist team as members of the facile consortium , to undertake the ne task in muc-7 .the main characteristics of this system employed are as follows : it is rule-based , its rule formalism supports context-sensitive partial parsing , rules may use pattern-matching-style iteration operators , the notation is much more readable than classic pattern-matching languages , rules can be assigned an explicit weight which is used in choosing between competing analyses , there is a method for identifying name-strings as coreferential with longer variants in the same text , the system does not employ learning techniques .the development of the system began only about 20 months ago , so it has not been used in any previous comparable trials .we looked forward to slightly higher scores than we obtained in the formal run , because at the dry run stage , we had obtained almost identical scores to our best results with training data .in the rest of this paper , we first give some background on the context in which the system used in the muc-7 ne task was developed .we then outline its internal structure , concentrating on the rule notation which is its most salient feature .an evaluation of its performance in the task then follows , before concluding with some speculation on the extent to which the approach adopted is susceptible to further improvement . context - sensitive partial parsing based on pattern - matching languages
2	unsupervised learning of name structure from coreference data . we present two methods for learning the structure of personal names from unlabeled data .the first simply uses a few implicit constraints governing this structure to gain a toehold on the problem e.g. , descriptors come before first names , which come before middle names , etc .the second model also uses possible coreference information .we found that coreference constraints on names improve the performance of the model from 92.6 % to 97.0 % .we are interested in this problem in its own right , but also as a possible way to improve named entity recognition ( by recognizing the structure of different kinds of names ) and as a way to improve noun-phrase coreference determination . unsupervised learning of name structure based on 
3	muc-7 named entity task definition . scope .the named entity task consists of three subtasks ( entity names , temporal expressions , number expressions ) .the expressions to be annotated are " unique identifiers " of entities ( organizations , persons , locations ) , times ( dates , times ) , and quantities ( monetary values , percentages ) . - 7 named entity task definition based on 
4	unsupervised models for named entity classification . this paper discusses the use of unlabeled examples for the problem of named entity classification .a large number of rules is needed for coverage of the domain , suggesting that a fairly large number of labeled examples should be required to train a classifier .however , we show that the use of unlabeled data can reduce the requirements for supervision to just 7 simple " seed " rules .the approach gains leverage from natural redundancy in the data : for many named-entity instances both the spelling of the name and the context in which it appears are sufficient to determine its type .we present two algorithms .the first method uses a similar algorithm to that of ( yarowsky 95 ) , with modifications motivated by ( blum and mitchell 98 ) .the second algorithm extends ideas from boosting algorithms , designed for supervised learning tasks , to the framework suggested by ( blum and mitchell 98 ) . named entity classification based on unsupervised models
5	large-scale named entity disambiguation based on wikipedia data . this paper presents a large-scale system for the recognition and semantic disambiguation of named entities based on information extracted from a large encyclopedic collection and web search results .it describes in detail the disambiguation paradigm employed and the information extraction process from wikipedia .through a process of maximizing the agreement between the contextual information extracted from wikipedia and the context of a document , as well as the agreement among the category tags associated with the candidate entities , the implemented system shows high disambiguation accuracy on both news stories and wikipedia articles . large - scale named entity disambiguation based on disambiguation paradigm
6	unsupervised named-entity extraction from the web : an experimental study . the knowitall system aims to automate the tedious process of extracting large collections of facts ( e.g. , names of scientists or politicians ) from the web in an unsupervised , domain-independent , and scalable manner .the paper presents an overview of knowitalls novel architecture and design principles , emphasizing its distinctive ability to extract information without any hand-labeled training examples .in its first major run , knowitall extracted over 50,000 class instances , but suggested a challenge : how can we improve knowitalls recall and extraction rate without sacrificing precision ?this paper presents three distinct ways to address this challenge and evaluates their performance .pattern learning learns domain-specific extraction rules , which enable additional extractions .subclass extraction automatically identifies sub-classes in order to boost recall ( e.g. , chemist and biologist are identified as sub-classes of scientist ) .list extraction locates lists of class instances , learns a wrapper for each list , and extracts elements of each list .since each method bootstraps from knowitalls domain-independent methods , the methods also obviate hand-labeled training examples .the paper reports on experiments , focused on building lists of named entities , that measure the relative efficacy of each method and demonstrate their synergy .in concert , our methods gave knowitall a 4-fold to 8-fold increase in recall at precision of 0.90 , and discovered over 10,000 cities missing from the tipster gazetteer . unsupervised named - entity extraction based on knowitalls novel architecture and design principles
7	a framework for named entity recognition in the open domain . in this paper , a system for named entity recognition in the open domain ( nero ) is described .it is concerned with recognition of various types of entity , types that will be appropriate for information extraction in any scenario context .the recognition task is performed by identifying normally capitalised phrases in a document and then submitting queries to a search engine to find potential hypernyms of the capitalised sequences .these hypernyms are then clustered to derive a typology of named entities for the document .the hypernyms of the normally capitalised phrases are used to classify them with respect to this typology .the method is tested on a small corpus and its classifications are evaluated .finally , conclusions are drawn and future work considered . named entity recognition based on search engine
8	identification and tracing of ambiguous names : discriminative and generative approaches . a given entity representing a person , a location or an organization may be mentioned in text in multiple , ambiguous ways .understanding natural language requires identifying whether different mentions of a name , within and across documents , represent the same entity .we present two machine learning approaches to this problem , which we call the robust reading problem .our first approach is a discriminative approach , trained in a supervised way .our second approach is a generative model , at the heart of which is a view on how documents are generated and how names ( of different entity types ) are sprinkled into them .in its most general form , our model assumes : ( 1 ) a joint distribution over entities ( e.g. , a document that mentions president kennedy is more likely to mention oswald or white house than roger clemens ) , ( 2 ) an author model , that assumes that at least one mention of an entity in a document is easily identifiable , and then generates other mentions via ( 3 ) an appearance model , governing how mentions are transformed from the representative mention .we show that both approaches perform very accurately , in the range of 90 % 95 % f , measure for different entity types , much better than previous approaches to ( some aspects of ) this problem .our extensive experiments exhibit the contribution of relational and structural features and , somewhat surprisingly , that the assumptions made within our generative model are strong enough to yield a very powerful approach , that performs better than a supervised approach with limited supervised information . identification and tracing of ambiguous names based on discriminative and generative approaches
9	a survey of named entity recognition and classification . the term named entity , now widely used in natural language processing , was coined for the sixth message understanding conference ( muc-6 ) ( r.grishman & sundheim 1996 ) .at that time , muc was focusing on information extraction ( ie ) tasks where structured information of company activities and defense related activities is extracted from unstructured text , such as newspaper articles .in defining the task , people noticed that it is essential to recognize information units like names , including person , organization and location names , and numeric expressions including time , date , money and percent expressions .identifying references to these entities in text was recognized as one of the important sub-tasks of ie and was called named entity recognition and classification ( nerc ) .we present here a survey of fifteen years of research in the nerc field , from 1991 to 2006 . named entity recognition and classification based on 
10	acquisition of categorized named entities for web search . the recognition of names and their associated categories within unstructured text traditionally relies on semantic lexicons and gazetteers .the amount of effort required to assemble large lexicons confines the recognition to either a limited domain ( e.g. , medical imaging ) , or a small set of predefined , broader categories of interest ( e.g. , persons , countries , organizations , products ) .this constitutes a serious limitation in an information seeking context .in this case , the categories of potential interest to users are more diverse ( universities , agencies , retailers , celebrities ) , often refined ( e.g. , slr digital cameras , programming languages , multinational oil companies ) , and usually overlapping ( e.g. , the same entity may be concurrently a brand name , a technology company , and an industry leader ) .we present a lightly-supervised method for acquiring named entities in arbitrary categories .the method applies lightweight lexico-syntactic extraction patterns to the unstructured text of web documents .the method is a departure from traditional approaches to named entity recognition in that : 1 ) it does not require any start-up seed names or training ; 2 ) it does not encode any domain knowledge in its extraction patterns ; 3 ) it is only lightly supervised , and data-driven ; 4 ) it does not impose any a-priori restriction on the categories of extracted names .we illustrate applications of the method in web search , and describe experiments on 500 million web documents and news articles . information seeking context based on lightly - supervised method
11	learning dictionaries for information extraction by multi-level bootstrapping . information extraction systems usually require two dictionaries : a semantic lexicon and a dictionary of extraction patterns for the domain .we present a multilevel bootstrapping algorithm that generates both the semantic lexicon and extraction patterns simultaneously .as input , our technique requires only unannotated training texts and a handful of seed words for a category .we use a mutual bootstrapping technique to alternately select the best extraction pattern for the category and bootstrap its extractions into the semantic lexicon , which is the basis for selecting the next extraction pattern .to make this approach more robust , we add a second level of bootstrapping ( meta- bootstrapping ) that retains only the most reliable lexicon entries produced by mutual bootstrapping and then restarts the process .we evaluated this multilevel bootstrapping technique on a collection of corporate web pages and a corpus of terrorism news articles .the algorithm produced high-quality dictionaries for several semantic categories . information extraction based on multilevel bootstrapping algorithm
