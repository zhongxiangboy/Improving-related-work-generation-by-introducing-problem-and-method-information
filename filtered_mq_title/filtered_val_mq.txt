3	testing subgraphs in directed graphs. we show that in this case g contains at least f(e, h)nh copies of h. this is proved by establishing a directed version of szemeredi s regularity lemma, and implies that for every h there is a one sided error property tester whose query complexity is bounded by a function of e only for testing the property ph of being h free.as is common with applications of the undirected regularity lemma, here too the function # f(e,h) is an extremely fast growing function in e. we therefore further prove a precise characterization of all the digraphs h, for which f(e,h) has a polynomial dependency on e. this implies a characterization of all the digraphs h, for which the property of being h free has a one sided error property tester whose query complexity is polynomial in # e. we further show that the same characterization also applies to two sided error property testers as well. we also show that the complexity of deciding if for a given directed graph h, ph has a polynomial query complexity, is np complete, marking an interesting distinction from the case of undirected graphs.for some special cases of directed graphs h, we describe very efficient one sided error property testers for testing ph. as a consequence we conclude that when h is an undirected bipartite graph, we can give a one sided error property tester with query complexity o((# e)h #), improving the previously known upper bound o((# e)h#).testing subgraphs based on a regularity lemma	contains a (v,  ,c#,  ) m sequence    for some #              #(c#) (  #(c#) as in the de   nition of the strong eh property). it can be proven (standard application of the regularity lemma for tournaments, see  <cite>) that n(v,  ) is    nite. formal proof may be found in <cite>, therefore we will not repeat it now. we will prove that every h free tournament t contains a transitive subtournament of size at least  t   (n,

81	delay bounds in a network with aggregate scheduling. this paper studies the bounds on the worst case delay in a network implementing aggregate scheduling. we derive an upper bound on the queuing delay as a function of priority traffic utilization and the maximum hop count of any flow, and the shaping parameters at the network ingress. our bound explodes at a certain utilization level which is a function of the hop count. we show that for a general network configuration and larger utilization utilization an upper bound on delay, if it exists, must be a function of the number of nodes and or the number of flows in the network.aggregate scheduling based on aggregate scheduling	as we also implemented the calculation of the bounds from <cite> (often called the charny bound) as part of the disco network calculator, we compute delay and backlog bound for these rst.

108	identifying the agricultural imprint on the global n#o budget using stable isotopes. we observed large shifts with time in the emission rate (from ### to ## ng n cm   # h   #) and in   ##n of n#o emitted (from    ##    to +#    relative to atmospheric n#) from a urea fertilized and irrigated agricultural field in mexico. we calculated overall instantaneous enrichment factors for the sampling period, which suggest that the microbial n#o production shifts from nitrification (week #) to denitrification (week #). the overall   ##n signature we measured for n#o emitted from n fertilized agricultural systems is more depleted than observed   ##n values for n#o emitted from more n limited forest soils. assuming that one half of the total agricultural n#o emissions associated with the global increase in soil nitrogen fertilizer use have an isotopic composition comparable to those of the agricultural fields reported here, we predict a decline in the isotopic signature of tropospheric n#o during this century of as much as #    for ##n. although many uncertainties remain, we suggest that measurements of   ##n n#o in firn air will provide constraints on how the n#o budget has changed during the past century.identification of the global n number of the urea fertification and irrigated agricultural	it is difficult to assess the proportion of n#o emissions attributed directly to fertilizer n addition without using isotopic tracers, such as ##n <cite>.

303	regulation of endothelial cell and platelet receptor ligand binding by the ## and ## lipoxygenase monohydroxides ## ## hete and ## hode. abstract   in previous studies, we reported that vascular wall cells such as endothelial cells metabolize linoleic acid to ## hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (## hode) via the ## lipoxygenase pathway. we and others have also found that tumour cell adhesivity is dependent, in part, upon the relative amounts of intracellular ## hode and the arachidonic acid monohydroxide(s), ##  and or ## hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (## , ## hete). in addition, we and others have found that platelet adhesivity is dependent upon the intraplatelet level of its major lipoxygenase metabolite, ## hete. finally, we have demonstrated that ## hode and vnr co localize in nonadhesive endothelial cells but dissociate following endothelial cell injury, at which time, the vnr relocates on the endothelial cell apical surface. these data suggest to us that lipoxygenase derived monohydroxides regulate the ability of various receptors to recognize their specific ligands. thus, we demonstrate that ## hode downregulates vnr binding with vitronectin (vn)   fibronectin (fn)   fibrinogen (fgn), whereas ##  and ## hete upregulate specific vnr ligand binding, using purified vnr liposomes and purified ligands in an adhesion assay  and that ##  and ## hete upregulate gpiib iiia liposome binding of fgn   fn   vn. we conclude that cell specific monohydroxides influence cell specific receptor ligand binding directly through aendothelial cell and platelet ligand binding based on lipoxy	in this context, ## hode, a recognized lipoxygenase product that downregulates platelet   ec interactions <cite>, is also generated by cox # (table i) and joins this pathway array and class of mediators.

366	verifying multi threaded software using smt based context bounded model checking. we describe and evaluate three approaches to model check multi threaded software with shared variables and locks using bounded model checking based on satisfiability modulo theories (smt) and our modelling of the synchronization primitives of the pthread library. in the lazy approach, we generate all possible interleavings and call the smt solver on each of them individually, until we either find a bug, or have systematically explored all interleavings. in the schedule recording approach, we encode all possible interleavings into one single formula and then exploit the high speed of the smt solvers. in the underapproximation and widening approach, we reduce the state space by abstracting the number of interleavings from the proofs of unsatisfiability generated by the smt solvers. in all three approaches, we bound the number of context switches allowed among threads in order to reduce the number of interleavings explored. we implemented these approaches in esbmc, our smt based bounded model checker for ansi c programs. our experiments show that esbmc can analyze larger problems and substantially reduce the verification time compared to state of the art techniques that use iterative context bounding algorithms or counter example guided abstraction refinement.model checking multi threaded software based on smt	there are also approaches that overcome the difficulties of using model checking on multi threaded programs with large search spaces <cite>.

769	optimistic linear programming gives logarithmic regret for irreducible mdps. we present an algorithm called optimistic linear programming (olp) for learning to optimize average reward in an irreducible but otherwise unknown markov decision process (mdp). we show that the total expected reward obtained by olp up to time t is within c(p) log t of the reward obtained by the optimal policy, where c(p) is an explicit, mdp dependent constant. olp is closely related to an algorithm proposed by burnetas and katehakis with four key differences  olp is simpler, it does not require knowledge of the supports of transition probabilities, the proof of the regret bound is simpler, but our regret bound is a constant factor larger than the regret of their algorithm.irreducible mdps based on optimistic linear programming	n ris completely known, with the only uncertainty being in the transition kernel of the unknown mdp. the extension to problems with unknown rewards is well known from here <cite>. a (stationary) policy or control cis a prescription to (deterministically) play an action at every state of the mdp, i.e., c  s   a. let cdenote the set of all stationary policies# over (s,a), which a
770	do bonds span volatility risk in the u s treasury market a specification test for affine term structure models. we investigate whether bonds span the volatility risk in the u.s. to this end, we construct powerful and model free empirical measures of the quadratic yield variation for a cross section of fixed maturity zero coupon bonds ( realized yield volatility ) through the use of high frequency data. we find that the yield curve fails to span yield volatility, as the systematic volatility factors are largely unrelated to the cross section of yields. we conclude that a broad class of affine diffusive, gaussian quadratic and affine jump diffusive models is incapable of accommodating the observed yield volatility dynamics. we also advocate using the empirical realized yield volatility measures more broadly as a basis for specification testing and (parametric) model selection within the term structure literature.affine term structure models based on high frequency data	<cite> have documented that an egarch representation for the conditional yield volatility provides a convenient and successful parsimonious model for the conditional heteroskedasticity in these series.
